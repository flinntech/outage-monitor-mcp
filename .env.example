# StatusGator API Key (OPTIONAL)
# Get your API key from: https://statusgator.com (Settings -> API)
#
# You can provide the API key in two ways:
# 1. Set it here as an environment variable (good for testing/development)
# 2. Pass it as a Bearer token in the Authorization header (recommended for n8n)
#
# If both are provided, the Bearer token takes precedence.
# If neither is provided, requests will fail with an authentication error.
